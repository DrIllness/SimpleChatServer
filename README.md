=================

In order to build this project, you need to download and add external library
Apache Commons Collections of the latest version. You need to:
1. Download Apache Commons Collections binaries, unless you already have it. Available on official web-site http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/download_collections.cgi
2. Copy *.jar to directory(e.g. "libs") in the project folder (you can create the directory if it`s not there)
3. Refresh project so libs show up in the structure (right click on the project top level hierarchy folder-> "Synchronize <ProjectName>") or reopen the structure window.
4. Expand libs in the structure window and right click on the *.jar file.
5. Select "Add as Library"

After this you should be able to build the project.
Client emulator is not included into this project.
